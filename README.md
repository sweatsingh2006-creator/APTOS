# AlumniDAO Mentoring Module

## 📖 Description
The **AlumniDAO::Mentoring** module is a Move smart contract designed to connect alumni mentors with students.  
- Alumni can **register as mentors** by submitting their name and area of expertise.  
- Students can **request mentoring** by querying a registered mentor’s expertise.  

This creates a decentralized and transparent mentoring ecosystem within the AlumniDAO community.

## 🌍 Vision
To build a **trustless on-chain mentoring network** that empowers students through alumni guidance, ensures credibility, and promotes knowledge sharing within a decentralized ecosystem.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add detailed mentor profiles (experience, availability, achievements).  
- Implement smart matching algorithms for mentor-student pairing.  
- Introduce feedback and rating systems for quality assurance.  
- Enable reward mechanisms for mentors (tokens or reputation points).  
- Integrate with AlumniDAO governance for decision-making and upgrades.
